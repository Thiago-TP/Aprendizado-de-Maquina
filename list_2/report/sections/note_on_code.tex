This report is the textual part of a greater bundle that also encompasses code.
The algorithms discussed in this report (PCA, k-means, logistic regression)
were implemented by the author in the Rust programming language, 
and stores the relevant data for later analysis as CSV files. 
%
Rust is known for its memmory safety and fast performance, even among compiled languages.
However, given its focus on systems applications, there is a lack of robust, mature plotting libraries.
%
Therefore, a Python script (\texttt{plots.py}) was written to process and extract from Rust's results 
any graph, plot or image that was deemed necessary to include in this report.

Both the Rust source code and well as the Python script were included in the bundle, 
and are available together with this report in an open Github repository made by the author:
